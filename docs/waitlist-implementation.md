- **Queue Management**: Episodes are automatically removed from waitlist when played
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when waitlist is empty or errors occur

### ✅ Phase 3: Enhanced UX
- **Drag & Drop**: Full reordering functionality using Angular CDK
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth animations and visual indicators during drag operations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with touch-friendly controls
- **Empty State**: User-friendly empty state with call-to-action
- **Dark Theme**: Fully compatible with Poddr's dark theme design system

## Implementation Details

### Services

#### WaitlistService (`src/app/services/waitlist.service.ts`)
- **Storage**: Uses electron-store for persistent storage
- **Data Model**: WaitlistEpisode interface with comprehensive episode metadata
- **Operations**: Add, remove, reorder, clear, get next episode
- **Real-time Updates**: BehaviorSubject for reactive UI updates

#### AudioService Extension (`src/app/services/audio.service.ts`)
- **Auto-play**: Modified `onEnded()` method to check for next episode
- **Circular Dependency**: Resolved using dynamic imports
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for auto-play failures

### Components

#### WaitlistComponent (`src/app/waitlist/waitlist.component.*`)
- **Drag & Drop**: Angular CDK implementation with visual feedback
- **Episode Management**: Play, remove, and reorder episodes
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Efficient change detection and memory management
- **Dark Theme**: Optimized colors and effects for dark backgrounds

### UI/UX Features

#### Visual Design
- **Dark Theme Integration**: Uses Poddr's CSS custom properties for consistent theming
  - `--primary-color` (#ff6600) for accents and highlights
  - `--primary-bg-color` (#111111) for main backgrounds
  - `--secondary-bg-color` (#151515) for card backgrounds
  - `--third-bg-color` (#222222) for hover states and borders
  - `--primary-text-color` (#efefef) for primary text
  - `--secondary-text-color` (#ababab) for secondary text
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, card-based design with dark-optimized hover effects
- **Drag Indicators**: Clear drag handles with dark theme appropriate colors
- **Playing State**: Orange accent highlighting for currently playing episode
- **Empty State**: Helpful guidance with properly contrasted text

#### User Interactions
- **Touch Support**: Mobile-friendly drag and drop
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Accessible keyboard controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Dark-optimized animations and state transitions
- **Error Messages**: Clear user feedback with appropriate contrast ratios

#### Dark Theme Optimizations
- **Shadows**: Enhanced shadows for better depth perception on dark backgrounds
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle background changes that work well in dark mode
- **Drag Preview**: High-contrast preview with proper dark background
- **Button States**: Orange-tinted hover states for better visibility
- **Remove Button**: Soft red color (#ff6b6b) that's easier on the eyes in dark mode

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User adds episode to waitlist from podcast page
2. WaitlistService stores episode with order information
3. WaitlistComponent displays episodes in order
4. User can reorder via drag & drop
5. When episode ends, AudioService plays next from waitlist
6. Played episode is automatically removed from waitlist

### Storage Schema
```typescript
interface WaitlistEpisode {
  guid: string;           // Unique episode identifier
  title: string;          // Episode title
  description: string;    // Episode description
  src: string;           // Audio file URL
  duration: number;       // Duration in seconds
  published: Date;        // Publication date
  image?: string;         // Episode artwork URL
  podcastTitle: string;   // Parent podcast title
  podcastRSS: string;     // Parent podcast RSS URL
  podcastImage: string;   // Parent podcast artwork
  order: number;          // Position in waitlist
  addedAt: Date;         // When added to waitlist
}
```

### Dependencies Added
- `@angular/cdk@^19.0.0`: For drag and drop functionality
